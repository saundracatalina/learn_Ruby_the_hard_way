Things I've learned in Ruby!
# if you put a pound sign in front of any line of code it knows not to run that line
# In Ruby the " (double-quote) tells Ruby to replace variables it finds with #{}
# but the ' (single-quote) tells Ruby to leave the string alone and ignore any variables inside it.
# when printing a line you can use print or puts in the beginning of the line
# puts is short for "put string"
# the difference is that puts adds a new line after executing and print does not



Things I don't get:
# %{stuff} formatting with this
